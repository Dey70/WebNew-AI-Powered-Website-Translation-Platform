                    WEEK 8 PROGRESS REPORT
                    Date: 18th August – 24th August 2025
================================================================================

What we did this week –
In Week 8, we focused on building the foundation for the backend and overall project structure, while aligning the website closer to professional platforms like weglot.com. Key accomplishments include:

• Established a clean folder structure for better organization:
  - /public – images, logos, and static assets
  - /styles – CSS files
  - /scripts – JavaScript files
  - /api – backend API functions (Next.js API routes)
  - index.html – main entry point

• Set up the initial backend foundation using a mock translation API (/api/translate.js).
  - Accepts text + target language.
  - Returns a simulated translated response for now.

• Connected the frontend Dashboard to the backend API via fetch requests.
  - Input text and selected language are sent to the API.
  - Mock translated output is displayed in the output textarea.

• Implemented a Translation History section (frontend-only, using localStorage).
  - Stores recent translations (up to 5).
  - Displays them neatly below the Dashboard for quick reference.

• Conducted cleanup and simplification of the design, removing unnecessary clutter to bring it closer to weglot.com style — clean, minimal, and professional.

Visuals Added –
• Dashboard → Backend Flow – Translation request/response simulation.
• History Section – Showing last 5 translations.
• Updated Folder Structure – Organized for frontend + backend.
• Landing Page (Refined) – Cleaner and closer to weglot.com reference.

Plan/Tasks for the Next Week –
• Expand backend API to handle more realistic translation logic.
• Start integrating a database (MongoDB or SQL) for storing translation history.
• Add more dynamic features to the history section (clear/delete options).
• Enhance UI responsiveness and polish transitions for Dashboard.
• Record an updated demo video showcasing end-to-end flow (Landing → Dashboard → History).
